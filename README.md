Write a program which can imitate a Grandma who's hard of hearing and follows these rules:

If you don't input anything (just hit enter) she responds with WHAT?!
If you ask a question with any lower-case letters, she responds with SPEAK UP, KID!
If you ask a question in all upper-case letters, she responds with NO, NOT SINCE 1946!
The first time you say GOODBYE! she says LEAVING SO SOON?
The second time you say GOODBYE! she says LATER, SKATER! and the program exits.
Example

HEY KID!
=> hi, grandma

SPEAK UP, KID!
=> I SAID HI, GRANDMA

NO, NOT SINCE 1946!
=>

WHAT?!
=> Goodbye!

SPEAK UP, KID!
=> GOODBYE!

LEAVING SO SOON?
=> GOODBYE!

LATER, SKATER!
